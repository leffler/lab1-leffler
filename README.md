Name?  
Timothy Leffler

What do you tell people about your field of study at a party?  
I'm a computer science major, then they ask if I can help them fix their computer. No.

In the past month, what are the three main activities you have been doing at work/study?  
Programming, programming, reading about programming

What are the three most important tools/strategies you use for organizing your work?  
I use a planner to keep track of when assignments are due, I also use folders to help organize all the papers I end up creating when I write down ideas/notes/etc, most importantly I have "sticky note" reminders on my computer to help make sure that I don't forget important things that are going on or that need to be done.
